# Neural Network From Scratch with Numpy

This project contains a neural network implementation using only the NumPy library in Python. The network supports fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and pooling layers, and is capable of learning on a variety of datasets.

## Features

This neural network implementation includes the following features:

- Fully connected layers
- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- ReLU activation function
- Linear activation function
- Sigmoid activation function
- Tanh activation function
- Mean Squared Error loss function
- Binary Cross-Entropy loss function
- Gradient Descent optimizer
- Adam optimizer

Additionally, the `Tumor-Project.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to use PyTorch to create a neural network for tumor classification.
